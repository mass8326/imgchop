# imgchop

Simple program that crops multiple images into squares!

- Easy to use - simply drag and drop your files onto the executable
- Nondestructive - cropped images get saved as new files in the same directory
- Lossless - outputs png files with no quality degradation

Made for my friends using [Photoboio's camera asset](https://photoboio.gumroad.com/l/rgiyyl) for VRChat.
