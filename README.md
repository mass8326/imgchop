# imgchop

Simple program that crops multiple images into squares!

- Easy to use - drag and drop your files onto the executable to crop each image in a single go
- Intelligent - drag and drop entire folders and only images with black bars will be cropped
- Nondestructive - cropped images get saved as new files in the same directory

Made for my friends who've been using [Photoboio Instant Camera](https://photoboio.gumroad.com/l/rgiyyl) for [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/).
